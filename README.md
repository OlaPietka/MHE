# Metaheuristics
## Description
In this project I implement few strategies to solve NP-complete problem called [Nonogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonogram). 

Implemented strategies:
* Tabu Search
* Hill Climb
* Simulated Annealing
* Genetic Algorithm
* Island Genetic Algorithm
* BruteForce

#### What is Nonogram?
Nonogram is picture logic puzzles in which cells in a grid must be colored or left blank according to numbers at the side of the grid to reveal a hidden picture.
